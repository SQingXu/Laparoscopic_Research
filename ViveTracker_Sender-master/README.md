#  What is this?
A rapid and simple example of how to start a background process for listening to HTC Vive Lighthouse tracking data. 

Uses OpenVR 1.0.5.

Compiled using Visual Studio 2013. Please adapt as suitable. 

##  How do I run it?
There is an executable in the Binary folder. Unarchive that and run it through a console after you've started Steam VR. Background processes are not allowed to start up SteamVR by themselves. 

##  How do I compile it?
1. Make sure that you point your includes and library bin folder to where you have openvr installed on your machine.
2. Make sure you've got the openvr_api.dll in the same folder as the built example

##  How do I use it?
1. Start up Steam VR
2. Compile and start the example - it launches as a background application


##  Troubleshooting:

*Unable to init VR runtime: Hmd Not Found (108)*

Solution: Attach the HMD to the computer


*Unable to init VR runtime: Not starting vrserver for background app (121)*

Solution: Start Steam VR
